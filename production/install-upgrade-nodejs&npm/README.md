# Installing and Updating Nodejs

### Step 1: Update Your Package Index
Open your terminal and run the following command to update your package index:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

### Step 2: Install Node.js
You have a couple of options to install Node.js. The recommended way is to use the NodeSource repository.

1. **Add the NodeSource PPA:**
   Choose the version you want to install (e.g., Node.js 18.x) and run:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
   ```

2. **Install Node.js:**
   After adding the repository, install Node.js using:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y nodejs
   ```

### Step 3: Verify Installation
Check if Node.js and npm were installed correctly:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Step 5: Update npm (Optional)
The version of npm that comes with Node.js might not be the latest. To update npm, run:

```bash
sudo npm install -g npm@latest
```

### Step 6: Test npm
You can test if npm is working by creating a new directory and initializing a new npm project:

```bash
mkdir test-npm
cd test-npm
npm init -y
```

If you already have the NodeSource repository set up, updating Node.js and npm is straightforward. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Step 1: Update Node.js
1. **Update the package index:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Upgrade Node.js:**
   To upgrade Node.js to the latest version from the NodeSource repository, run:

   ```bash
   sudo apt upgrade -y nodejs
   ```

### Step 2: Update npm
You can update npm to the latest version using npm itself:

1. **Run the following command:**

   ```bash
   sudo npm install -g npm@latest
   ```

### Step 3: Verify Updates
Check the versions of Node.js and npm to ensure they have been updated successfully:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Optional: Check for LTS Version
If you want to switch to a specific version (like the latest LTS), you can reinstall using the setup script:

1. **Run the NodeSource setup script again:**

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
   ```

2. **Install/Upgrade Node.js:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y nodejs
   ```

### Summary
By following these steps, you should be able to update Node.js and npm easily.
